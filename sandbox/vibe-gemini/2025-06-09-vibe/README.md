## Prompt

can you help write an HTML file with JavaScript and CSS hosted on GitHub pages that opens up a file on GitHub, allows me to edit the file, and saves the file back to GitHub pages. The entire application must be run from from vanilla JavaScript hosted on GitHub pages. User data such as toens are kept in local storage. Autosave to GitHub is implemented with saves no faster than every 15 seconds.
